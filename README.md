<h1>Vulnerability-Management</h1>
Briefly described below is a walkthrough of credentialled and non-credentialed scans through Microsoft Azure. In this lab, a Windows 10 virtual machine(VM) was created and scanned through a vulnerability management server.<br />

<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines)
- Greenbone Vulnerability Management 


<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

- HP Windows 11 laptop 

<h2>Virtual Machine Creation Process </h2>

Created a vulnerability management server using OpenVAS.

SSH into the Management server using PowerShell to deploy OpenVAS.

Created the Windows VM that will be monitored for vulnerabilities using OpenVAS.

Within the Windows VM, outdated versions of Firefox, Adobe Reader, and VLC player were downloaded.

Within OpenVAS a host was created to conduct an unauthorized credential scan.

Given that this was not a credentialled scan, the outdated download vulnerabilities were not listed in the non-credentialed scan report results. Before the credentialed scan was conducted, configurations such as the disabling of the Windows VM firewall, disabling of the user account controls, and the enabling of the remote registry occurred.

After the configurations, a credentialled scan was conducted showcasing a change in severity levels for the Windows VM.

In the results of the credentialled scan, a good amount of the observed results were vulnerabilities related to the outdated downloads in the Windows VM, with Adobe being the most recurrent.

A second credentialled scan was conducted once Firefox, VLC, and Adobe Reader were removed. As can be seen in the “Trend” portion of the screenshot, a downward trajectory can be observed. This implied some remediation occurred once the un-installment of outdated applications took place.

What can be seen in the results of the second credentialled scan is the absence of any of the vulnerabilities associated with Firefox, VLC player, and Adobe Reader.
